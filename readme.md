# DocServer

The source release of the DocServer web app, and a Node app that generates Markdown pages for the verb apps.

### This is an OPML application

If you have an outliner that can emit OPML, you can create and maintain a set of man-pages in Markdown, as I am doing with Drummer and the docs for the built-in verbs that come with its scripting language. 

You can also browse the same outline in a web app with a GUI-style interface., 

Each approach has its advantages.
