# DocServer

The source release of the DocServer web app, a Node app that generates Markdown pages for the verb apps, and the Markdown pages the app generates.

### Links to various stuff

1. The <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/">deployed version</a> of the web app.

2. The <a href="https://github.com/scripting/docServer/tree/main/docs">Markdown pages</a> with a list of all the Drummer verbs.

3. The <a href="https://github.com/scripting/docServer/tree/main/markdownapp">Node app</a> that generates the Markdown files from the outlines. 

4. The <a href="https://github.com/scripting/docServer/tree/main/webapp">souce</a> for the web app. 

5. Questions, comments? Post an item in this <a href="https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/148">thread</a>. 

### This is an OPML application

If you have an outliner that can emit <a href="http://opml.org/">OPML</a>, you can create and maintain a set of man-pages in Markdown, as I am doing with <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com/">Drummer</a> and the docs for the built-in verbs in its scripting language. 

You can also browse the same outline in a <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/">web app</a> with a GUI-style interface., 

Each approach has its advantages. :smile:
